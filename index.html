          <h3>About me:</h3>
          <p>I started coding in January 2023 and loved it ever since. I love being challenged and the feeling of solving a problem that I have been stuck on for awhile. I enjoy the design aspect of web development and the joy of personalizing web pages the way I see fit. </p>
          <p>I have always worked in a team and having other individuals to bounce ideas of is an amazing aspect of web development.</p>
          <p>Collaboration in the web development space is a wonderful aspect that is engraved into the culture of tech. Having a support system is a must for me in any endeavor I begin.</p>
