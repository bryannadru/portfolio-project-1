          <h3>About Bryanna</h3>
          <p>I began coding in January 2023 and became deeply invested in the world tech.</p>
          <p>I was attracted to web development because I knew I could explore my joy for design.</p>
          <p>Additionally, I loved that I could develop projects that interested me while integrating programming.</p>
          <p>I love having a team and taking every possibility to collaborate ideas and make the workspace a great environment.</p>
