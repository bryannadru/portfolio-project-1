          <h3>About me:</h3>
          <p>I started coding in January 2023 and loved it ever since. I love being challenged and the feeling of solving a problem that I have been stuck on for awhile. I enjoy the design aspect of web development and the joy of personalizing web pages the way I see fit. </p>
          <p>I have always worked in a team and having other individuals to bounce ideas of is an amazing aspect of web development.</p>
          <p>Collaboration in the web development space is a wonderful aspect that is engraved into the culture of tech. Having a support system is a must for me in any endeavor I begin.</p>
          <p>This is a list of my favorite hobbies in order to get to know me a little better: </p>
          <!-- ordered list-->
          <ul>Ceramics, Going to the beach, Horseback Riding, Reading, Shopping, Traveling</ul>
          <p>Lastly, I think a fun way to get to know someone is from their music taste. </p>
          <p>Here is a list of my favorite artists (in no particular order)</p>
          <!--unordered list -->
          <ol>Drake, Tame Impala, Brent Faiyaz, Burna Boy</ol>
